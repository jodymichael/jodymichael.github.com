    <td class="contentL"><p><strong>We are close to having enough participants to move forward this year</strong> (it is not about cost, but about having what we consider to be a critical mass of participants), but we would like to see more interest among previous attendees.</p>
      <p>If you are planning to come to this year's Summit and have not yet submitted and application (you are automatically eligible as a previous participant), we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We will be making a decision no later than the end of September about whether to go forward with this year's meeting.</p>
      <p>We now have 98 members on our LinkedIn group. A number of requests for feedback on the agenda of this year's meeting have received almost no responses. You have been a part of this community in the past, but very few are participating in discussions about our future, or have given any indication of an intention to attend this year.</p>
    <p>We are in our final drive to increase attendance at this year's Summit. We also remain committed to trying to engage potential attendees in co-creating our agenda prior to arriving at the Summit (in other words, now). </p></td>
                         <td class="contentR"><p>Based on the feedback we have received, there will be:</p>
                           <ul>
                             <li>an experiential workshop using Bob Kegan and Lisa Lahey's Overcoming Immunity to Change methodology</li>
                             <li>a group discussion on executive burnout</li>
                             <li>a discussion about the future of ECS and our mission as an organization</li>
                             <li>time allotted for topics that come up once we are in the room together</li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>If you have not signed up for the LinkedIn group and wish to remain involved in ECS, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupRegistration?gid=1226347" target="_blank">please sign up now</a>.</p>
                           <p>Once you are a member, we encourage you to participate in discussions about this year's Summit and about the future of ECS.</p>
                           <p>The website for this year's Summit is <a href="http://www.ecs2009.com" target="_blank">www.ecs2009.com</a>. There is an application form on the website (previous attendees need only fill in minimal information) and a way to pay for the summit through Paypal.</p>

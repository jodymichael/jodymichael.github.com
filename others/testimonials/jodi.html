		    <p><span class="text"><b>&#147</b>Jody Michael helped me discover 
              my passion in work and provided structure and guidance to help me 
              reach my goals. Since working with her, my business has steadily 
              grown &#151; and I haven't even finished sending out my announcements. 
              One of the reasons that Jody stands out among other coaches I've 
              talked with is the combination of skills she brings to coaching. 
              Prior to coaching, Jody was successful in the corporate world and 
              as an entrepreneur. She clearly understands the business world. 
              Jody's advice has saved me both time and money. Additionally, Jody 
              understands people and how to help them remove or minimize obstacles 
              to reaching goals. She is empathetic, realistic and practical. I 
              am lucky to have found her.<b>&#148</b></span></p>

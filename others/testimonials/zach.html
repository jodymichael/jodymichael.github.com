		    <p><span class="text"><b>&#147</b>Perhaps, accountants wake up one day 
              and realize they can't add any more. I don't know. I do know that 
              I woke up one day and I couldn't write. This sounds silly. Yet, 
              the inability to create professional articles and stories can be 
              unbearable. When I started working with Jody Michael, I had barely 
              written in two years. In a short time, Ms. Michael had me writing 
              into the night with new focus. A few months later, I sold my first 
              professional piece÷ She leads you to achieve what you believed was 
              impossible. This process can be difficult, but the reward is beautiful.<b>&#148</b></span></p>

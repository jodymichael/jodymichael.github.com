              type-honors in high school, college, and business school, a 'successful' 
              work history-but I wasn't really happy. After working with Jody, 
              I realized that what I wanted to do was switch from being a consultant 
              to working in ministry. It has been a great move! Jody helped me 
              reframe some of my thought patterns and freed me up. She has a pragmatic 
              approach that really helped a gear-spinner like me to stop spinning 
              and proactively move forward. I've already recommended her to three 
              friends. Coaching has gotten pretty trendy and I think there are 
              lots of people hanging up a shingle that may not be that strong. 
              But Jody's the real deal.<b>&#148</b></span></p>

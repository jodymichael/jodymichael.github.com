          <div class="tab-section no-navigation"><p>&#8220;Jody was skilled at helping me identify business solutions that helped my global organization and my own work’s focus. This, combined with the time to reflect on personal priorities and hopes for the future, made my time with Jody extremely valuable. I was referred to Jody by a fellow Kellogg Business School alum whom I respect greatly; the end result for this person of working with Jody was a significant change in professional and personal focus that helped them realize one of their life’s dreams. Consulting time spent with Jody Michael is time well invested.&#8221;<br />
<em>&#8212; Beth Houle, Chief of Staff, Opportunity International</em></p>
<p>&#8220;One day I realized that I was thinking differently, seeing differently, acting differently and perceiving differently. For me, it happened in what seemed like a blink of the eye. In fact, it had been months of participation in a leadership development initiative that my company spearheaded with Jody Michael Associates that shaped this &#8216;new me.&#8217;</p>
<p>My biggest returns were: (1) a shift away from managerial thinking to leadership thinking and (2) confirmation from others that my performance had changed significantly. On a recent 360 review I was rated ‘exceeds expectations’ in multiple categories. That level of evaluation was new for me. Either my boss suddenly became an easy grader or my performance had reached new levels. I prefer to believe it was the latter.&quot;<br />
<em>&#8212; Linda M., Senior Associate, Consulting Firm serving Fortune 500</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I have worked with Jody for the past two years and can provide my highest recommendation.  Jody brings a fresh perspective to the workings of my business and in particular, my effectiveness as a leader.   She asks the tough questions and enables me to make an honest assessment of my strengths and weaknesses.   Her focus on pragmatic, results-oriented coaching has enabled me to take my business to the next level.&#8221;<br />

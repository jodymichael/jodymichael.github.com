<ul>
	<li><strong>Self:</strong> We start at the core of the individual leader or leadership team. Who you are, how you think and ‘see,’ what you believe, how authentic, courageous and self-aware you are, and how effectively you manage your energy and the energy of others … all factor heavily into your capacity to lead.</li>
	<li><strong>Influence:</strong> How flexible you are in adapting your leadership style, how you inspire, influence and develop your team, how effectively you gain buy-in, and whether a foundation of trust and respect anchors your leadership are important areas that we help cultivate.</li>
	<li><strong>Performance:</strong> To help you significantly impact your organizational results we look at what you do, how you do it, your standards, focus, accountability measurements, management of priorities and strategies, communication skills, belief in your team’s capabilities and your effectiveness in adapting and leading change.</li>
	<li><strong>Vision:</strong> To stay competitive in a rapidly changing marketplace requires vision, strategic thinking, belief in aligned collaboration and sophisticated leadership. Together, we create a catalyst for fresh perspectives, deeper trust and accountability–based leadership that inspires passion around bigger missions and deeper shared purpose.</li>

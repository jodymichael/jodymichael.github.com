          <div class="tab-section no-navigation"><p>&#8220;I am delighted to offer an endorsement of the seminar we experienced led by Jody Michael.  We found the Conversations for Accountability to be of great value to our organization, providing common language, shared experience and heightened awareness and sensitivity in our institutional work.</p>
<p>Our staff has benefited from having the productive dialogue and the work in the seminar has encouraged greater, more thoughtful communication.  Our organization is extremely proud of its high standard of customer service to our patrons and Jody&#8217;s seminar increases our internal productivity and customer service as well.  We have only just begun our work together with this new &#8216;language&#8217; but we are already seeing how it has been of great value for us in our professional as well as personal lives.&quot;<br />
<em>&#8212; Deborah Rutter, President, Chicago Symphony Orchestra</em></p>
<p>&#8220;We are very frugal when it comes to spending money and want to make sure we get value. So, it speaks volumes that our company has used Jody Michael as our business consultant, executive coach, leadership development trainer and corporate culture shaper for over five years.</p>
<p>She challenges us, shapes our leadership capabilities, offers invaluable guidance, and &#8217;just in time&#8217; learning that continually pays dividends. She&#8217;s more than a consultant or coach; she&#8217;s part of our &#8216;family.&#8217; </p>
<p>Over the years, we&#8217;ve grown tremendously as a company. We&#8217;ve grown in size, accountability, culture, leadership capability, and in our vision. She&#8217;s been there coaching, consulting and shaping us since the beginning. We would highly recommend her to any organization, large or small.&quot;<br />

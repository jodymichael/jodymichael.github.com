          <div class="tab-section no-navigation"><p>&#8220;I interviewed many people before choosing to work with Jody Michael.  Her own personal style is direct and constructive, and her toolset is unique and comprehensive.  This combination makes her a great choice for someone who wants to reshape their role in their existing position or to re-imagine their future.&#8221;<br />
<em>&#8212; Martha Gilmore, Vice President, Chicago Symphony Orchestra</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Our work has been an eye-opening experience. And, it has made a huge difference in my approach and therefore success at work and within life overall.&#8221;<br />
<em>&#8212; Heather Collins, Director of Marketing, Sara Lee Corporation</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Up front Jody focused on getting to know the professional environment in which I am immersed daily, as well as me personally. We then engaged in a coaching process that was transformational. Remarkable results, personal satisfaction, and a sense of harmony followed in an effortless manner.&#8221;<br />
<em>&#8212; Frank Pacholec, Vice President, Stepan Company</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Jody has an exceptional ability to produce results for her clients by helping them focus their attention on the most important issues of any given situation. The benefits that I have derived from our working relationship are immeasurable and I would recommend her without hesitation.&#8221;<br />
<em>&#8212; Michael Izhaky, Founding Partner, FT Options</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Jody brings an amazing combination of intellect, insight, empathy, corporate savvy, objectivity, and philosophy to the table. So she is able not only to help people identify their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, but also provides tools for them to achieve the next level. And all this with a view to sustainable real change &#8211; not a temporary crutch, but an integrated approach to bringing forth your source of greatest energy.&#8221;<br />

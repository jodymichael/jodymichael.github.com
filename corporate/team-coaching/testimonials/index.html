          <div class="tab-section no-navigation"><p>&#8220;Jody Michael worked with our team on how to communicate more effectively to achieve better results. We realized how incomplete our prior conversations were within our team. Her techniques helped us to identify the areas where we could improve our communication and how to manage those conversations to gain positive outcomes. We have learned to communicate better with each other, as well as with external stakeholders and clients. Working with Jody Michael Associates ultimately helped us to individually and collectively bring our team’s performance to a much higher level.&#8221;<br />
<em>&#8212; Tim Rowan, Senior Software Engineer, FT Options</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Despite our best intentions, we were a team that did not execute well. Consistently, we were unable to deliver on time, got weighed down in ‘to-do’s’ and created a state of overwhelm.</p>
<p>Then we learned. We learned how to have fewer and shorter meetings. We learned how to be accountable and hold other members accountable. We learned to be comfortable with dissention and having difficult conversations. Finally, after our work with Jody Michael Associates we realized that we had learned to think, process and speak differently. Simple distinctions had made all the difference in the world. We’ve performed at a level that was not only new to us but was unimaginable just a few weeks earlier.&quot;<br />

		    <p><img src="lindgren.jpg" width="213" height="300" hspace="3" vspace="5" align="right">Entering 
              real estate sales was a natural progression for Laura Lindgren. 
              She managed apartment buildings for 15 years and fully enjoyed the 
              process of helping people. She was a natural fit for a 225 unit 
              high-rise condominium building in River North selling to first time 
              buyers, empty nesters, and investors.</p>
            <p>&quot;Laura is an extremely diligent and hard working person. Her 
              follow through and attention to detail are phenomenal,&quot; says 
              Millie Rosenbloom, CEO of The Habitat Company. &quot;If you want 
              something done - and done right the first time, call Laura,&quot; 
              Millie added.</p>
            <p>A graduate of Harrington Institute of Design, Laura now uses her 
              discriminating eye in design to help home owners stage and sell 
              their homes at the most competitive price possible. Laura currently 
              resides in the Lakeview neighborhood with her husband, teenage daughter 
              and two adorable pugs named Otis and Twyla. </p>

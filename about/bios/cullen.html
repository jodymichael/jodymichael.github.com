		    <p><img src="cullen.jpg" hspace="3" vspace="5" border="1" align="right">Due 
              to Jody Michael's tenure in trading and financial services, many 
              clients hail from these industries. In an effort to address their 
              needs, JMA partners with Software Options.</p>
			<p>Software Options is an independent firm that develops transaction 
              processing systems for the trading of derivative financial products. 
              The firm caters to individuals and small trading companies that 
              require back-office exchange communication tools and the flexibility 
              that can only be found in a customized package. Clients increase 
              profit and efficiency, limit risk, manage communications according 
              to their own parameters, and retain their ability to modify proprietary 
              algorithms and trading styles in-house.</p>
			<p>The elegance and dependability of Software Options products are a result of the two principals' 30+ years of experience designing, building, and implementing systems in the trading industry.</p>
			<p><strong>Cathy Cullen, Principal</strong> &#150; Software Options: 
              Cathy Cullen, the founder of Software Options, has been a technologist 
              in this field since 1987. She was a lead developer for the first 
              electronic trading system implemented worldwide, Project A at the 
              Chicago Board of Trade. Cullen has specialized knowledge in the 
              technologies that drive risk management for OTC derivative products.</p>
			<p><strong><img src="ben.jpg" hspace="3" align="left">Ben Galewsky, 
              Principal</strong> &#150; Software Options: Before his work at Software 
              Options, Galewski was the Chief Technical Architect for Swiss Bank's 
              investment banking division, UBC Warburg. In this position, he developed 
              the division's business process architecture and led development 
              of an interest rate derivative trading system. He provides seventeen 
              years experience as a technologist in the trading industry, as well.</p>

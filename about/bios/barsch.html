              Graphics [JBG] provides custom printing and direct mail fulfillment 
              to businesses both large and small. Though incorporated in 1999, 
              the firm serves its clients with the sophistication of a seasoned 
              pro and the service of a family friend. Together, the father and 
              son duo that founded the company account for over 35 years of experience 
              in the industry. They possess hands-on familiarity with nearly all 
              facets of print production, customer service, and communications 
              strategy. </p>
            <p>This background places JBG at a unique position in the print industry. 
              Traditionally, customers have had to choose between large production 
              houses that offer volume, a range of equipment, but marginal service, 
              or smaller vendors who favor personal service, but are frequently 
              limited by a lack of equipment and the extent of their know-how. 
            </p>
            <p>Inspired by this service vacuum, <strong>J</strong>eff and <strong>B</strong>ob 
              Barsch opened <strong>JB</strong> Graphics to serve those clients 
              who require personal service, expert advice and a multitude of printing 
              options. Today, Jeff and his knowledgeable staff offer a wide range 
              of production capabilities and the patient guidance that guarantees 
              all projects receive the attention and specific equipment that will 
              compliment the messages they carry.</p>
            <p>In addition to print production, JB Graphics offers clients turn-key 
              direct marketing solutions. This service provides all of the capabilities 
              a business needs to build its brand equity via direct mail or print 
              media. Clients employ JBG&#8217;s marketing strategy consultation, 
              design and copywriting services in the development of many of their 
              campaigns. Rather than bear the personnel expense, loss of productivity, 
              and occasional costly missteps, many businesses prefer to hand-off 
              every task associated with direct mail production. JBG clients utilize 
              our professionals to coordinate list rental, printing, mailing, 
              storage and other execution details. In short, JBG takes print campaigns 
              from idea to result quickly and efficiently.</p>

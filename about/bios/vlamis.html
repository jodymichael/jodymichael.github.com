              Vlamis, President and Co-founder of A &amp; N Mortgage Services, 
              enjoys a challenge. In particular, she and her thirty-four colleagues 
              specialize in finding the best mortgage product for each of their 
              home-buying customers. Whereas many financial institutions shy away 
              from customers who have less-than-perfect credit records, Neena 
              and A &amp; N boast a winning record with clients from all ends 
              of the spectrum--good credit, bad credit, or no credit.</p>
            <p>While Neena and the professionals at A &amp; N assist all clients 
              to find the best mortgage product for their needs, they demonstrate 
              an incredible range of talent when the client-situation requires 
              creative solutions. A &amp; N succeeds in difficult home-financing 
              scenarios as a result of its unparalleled commitment to providing 
              honest advice, its extensive breadth of personal finance knowledge 
              vis-&agrave;-vis home ownership, and the strength of its relationships 
              with over fifty banks. These three assets, in combination, have 
              built A &amp; N Mortgage Services into the premier originator of 
              residential home loans in the Chicagoland area.</p>
            <p>Whether you enjoy a great credit history or have suffered a few 
              mistakes in the past, you can be confident that Neena Vlamis and 
              A &amp; N Mortgage will identify the optimal financial product and 
              strategy for your specific home-ownership need.</p>

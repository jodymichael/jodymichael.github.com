              is a decisive marketer who can create order out of chaos by clearly 
              defining objectives and maintaining focus on results. She has a 
              proven track record of results with both entrepreneurial ventures 
              and established businesses of all sizes. Lisa is particularly skilled 
              in creating and implementing new business propositions, strategic 
              plans, market research and brand building initiatives.</p>
            <p>Lisa is a founding partner of The Marketing Studio, a marketing 
              consulting firm whose mission is to develop growth strategies and 
              new product concepts that will deliver profitable top line business 
              results for its clients. She has led projects for large companies 
              such as BBDO Atlanta, Pillsbury&#8217;s Green Giant brand, Keebler&#8217;s 
              Murray Biscuit Company, Caribou Coffee and for entrepreneurs working 
              to introduce new businesses in the food, toy and game, and cable 
              industries. Lisa led the BBDO Atlanta new business team in landing 
              the Simmons Mattress account, $10 million in billings, during a 
              three agency competitive bid. While working with a local entrepreneur, 
              Lisa managed a regional test market of a niche gourmet ketchup, 
              Grand Lyon Bordeaux Ketchup. She was responsible for creating and 
              implementing a fully integrated marketing plan including advertising, 
              consumer promotion, and public relations events. Ultimately Lisa 
              worked on the sale of this business to a Fortune 500 company. </p>
            <p>Prior to her consulting career Lisa held executive positions with 
              Kraft Foods and The Hewlett-Packard Company. She began her marketing 
              career with Kraft Foods where she was instrumental in establishing 
              the Beverage Division as a leader in the juice drink category. Earlier, 
              as a sales manager with Hewlett-Packard, Lisa honed her selling 
              skills by achieving sales growth in her geographic territory despite 
              a high tech recession. Her accomplishments have earned her a Georgia 
              Marketing Max Award and a place in Who&#8217;s Who of American Business 
              Women.</p>
            <p>Lisa holds a Masters in Business Administration from The Harvard 
              Business School. She has a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical 
              Engineering, awarded cum laude, from Tufts University.</p>

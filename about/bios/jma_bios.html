		  <p class="subhead">Jody Michael, Principal</p>
		  <p><span class="text"><b>&#147</b>Jody Michael helped me get back in touch with my true passions and ambitions. After spending 16 turbulent years at the VP-level in several Fortune 500 companies, I thought I had all the answers. Nevertheless, I decided to use Jody as my Executive Coach 'to keep me honest' during my next job search. Jody took me through a process of introspection and discovery tailored specifically to my needs. To my surprise, I came out the other end of this process with a much different, and much better, view of myself, my abilities, and the options available to me. Today, I'm much happier, healthier, and professionally fulfilled because Jody helped me listen to what my inner self has been telling me for a long time. I did the work, but Jody guided me through every step. I would heartily recommend her to anyone seeking to get themselves 'back on track' &#151; whether personally or professionally.<b>&#148</b></span></p>

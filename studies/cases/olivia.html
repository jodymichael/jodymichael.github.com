		    <p class="subhead">Olivia: New Managerial Skills</p>
		    <p><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
              As frequently happens, this next case begins with a referral. A 
              couple months into the promotion of an employee (Olivia) to management, 
              Ascend Company realized that Olivia had difficulty developing suitable 
              relationships with her team. Up to this point, Olivia was a stellar 
              employee. She had rotated successfully through many departments.</p> 
              <p>Olivia was a newly promoted manager at a mid-sized provider 
              of fasteners we will call The Ascend Company . After four years, 
              she had rotated successfully through several departments. She began 
              as a cost accountant, spent some time observing the sales and marketing 
              function, and was now working in the warehouse as an interim manager 
              of shipping and receiving while the incumbent manager was on maternity 
              leave. This temporary assignment offered Olivia her first experience 
              leading a team in the business world-and provided The Ascend Company 
              a benign test of Olivia's management skills.</p>
              <p>In the first month of the new assignment, Ascend management realized 
              that Olivia had difficulty developing suitable relationships with 
              her team. Even though the department was small, and the situation 
              of her promotion unique, Ascend was concerned to learn of Olivia's 
              communication deficiencies in a leadership setting. She had been 
              an outstanding employee, but she would be limited to non-management 
              roles unless something was done. At a meeting where the performance 
              of the shipping function, was being discussed, one of the regional 
              sales managers suggested the company call Jody Michael &amp; Associates. 
            </p>
              
            <p><strong>Resolution:</strong><br>
              In their first meeting, Jody Michael assured Olivia that though 
              The Ascend Company was paying the bill, anything that they discussed 
              would remain confidential. Furthermore, referring to the work as 
              'management development,' Olivia felt better about the process and 
              its goal. It was not a critique or judgment of her performance, 
              but an investment in her future at the company. She committed to 
              work with JMA, at normal cost to Ascend, for three months of one 
              session per week.</p>
            <p>Ms. Michael's assessment of Olivia, as well as her experience of 
              her client, was that she had difficulty extending herself to others. 
              In session, coach and client completed interactive exercises that 
              built Olivia's ability to receive negative feedback, to constructively 
              approach co-workers with whom she was disappointed or angry, and 
              to plan and lead meetings. As a result of the confidentiality clause 
              in their contract, Olivia was able to discuss issues that occurred 
              principally in her life outside of work, but that had a residual 
              affect on the job. </p>
              
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
              Through a combination of diligent introspection, immersion training 
              in communication and leadership skills, and her ability to immediately 
              practice her new tools on the job, Olivia progressed quickly. JMA's 
              Life RoadMap curriculum demonstrated the successful interaction 
              of life and work. It showed her how to set goals and achieve them 
              while maintaining the recovery time she needed for herself. Her 
              new awareness of how family issues carried over into her performance 
              on the job encouraged her to seek her own outside assistance for 
              those challenges.</p>
            <p>Almost as an after-affect, but a requirement that brought this 
              whole process about, Olivia altered her internal dialogue to enhance 
              her self-esteem. As a result, she exhibited the confidence team 
              members expect of a leader, and removed the closed, protective shroud 
              that had made collaboration difficult.</p>
            <p>Olivia's improvement through the final weeks of her interim assignment 
              encouraged Ascend's management to give her another position of responsibility; 
              Manufacturing Manager. As a result of her experience with Jody Michael 
              &amp; Associates, her hard work, and her willingness to work through 
              her weaknesses, Olivia's career in management has continued.</p>

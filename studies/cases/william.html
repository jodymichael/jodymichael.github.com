		    <p><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
            William  approached Jody Michael & Associates with a decision he'd been struggling with for many months.  He was unhappy in his marriage.  However, he did not want to turn the lives of his three children upside-down.</p>
              
            <p><strong>Resolution:</strong><br>
              To start, Jody Michael and William examined his inner dialogue for 
              clues that might favor one course of action or another. Should William 
              initiate divorce? Should he try to get custody of his children? 
              Could he be a single parent and earn a comfortable living at the 
              same time? These are just a few of the many questions that needed 
              answers.</p>
              <p>Through in-session exercises and background discovery assignments, 
              William came to understand his motivations with a clarity that enabled 
              him not only to make decisions, but to plan future goals. In a proprietary 
              JMA curriculum called Life RoadMap, William detailed his immediate 
              and long-term aspirations. His objective was ambitious: to provide 
              a peaceful transition for his children while caring for his own 
              needs and starting a new life. William's Life RoadMap served as 
              a guide and benchmark for the journey.</p>
              <p>From her facilitation of William's self-discovery, Jody Michael 
              had an understanding of the history and caveats of the situation, 
              but was removed far enough so that she could offer objective insight. 
              She provided support for the day-to-day choices that barraged her 
              client during the legal separation. Ms. Michael carefully directed 
              William toward the goal he had identified in his RoadMap.</p>
              <p>Coaching is different from the psychotherapist-client agreement 
              in that it is not ruled by process. Whereas a psychotherapy client 
              benefits from a self-discovery that may meander, the coaching client 
              employs the coach to motivate him to achieve the result he has identified.</p>
              
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
              William accomplished a successful divorce. More important, he launched 
              a new life in which he was able to care for his children as well 
              as himself. William continued to call on JMA for other emerging 
              issues such as stress management, single parenthood, a new career 
              as an entrepreneur, and a renewed interest in dating and social 
              life.</p>

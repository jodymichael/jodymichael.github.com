		    <p class="subhead">David: You don't need a diploma.</p>
			<p><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
              David sought out Jody Michael &amp; Associates to test a dream that 
              had been nagging him for awhile. For the previous twelve years, 
              he had worked the men's furnishings department in a couple high-end 
              signature stores along Michigan Avenue in Chicago. While he had 
              been earned one promotion to the position of department manager, 
              and this was the pinnacle of men's retail fashion in the Midwest, 
              he had never surpassed $40,000 per year.</p>
              <p>Every day, David interacted with professional and executive men 
              while he put together their wardrobes. Through the years, he had 
              wondered what his customers had that he did not. On the surface, 
              David only lacked a college degree. </p>
            <p><strong>Resolution:</strong><br>
              In two weeks, Jody Michael had assessed that David lacked very little. 
              He was intelligent, articulate and politically savvy-all attributes 
              that prepared him for the business world. Through a series of immersion 
              techniques, JMA replaced David's nagging feeling of under-employment 
              with a confidence that yearned for him to test his skills. This 
              confidence overshadowed the fact that he did not possess a degree.</p> 
              <p>Encouraged to dream, Dave identified his goals: a corporate position 
              that included a company car and an eventual six-figure salary. Within 
              four months, he landed a promising job with a growing mid-sized 
              company. He had the company car, a gas mileage expense account and 
              a $60,000+ salary.</p>
              <p>In total, David worked with JMA for nine months and periodically 
              checked in thereafter. With each new rung on the corporate ladder, 
              David faced a host of new challenges. He frequently tapped Jody's 
              executive experience for the minute details he could not have learned 
              in the retail environment: career development, the etiquette of 
              hierarchical corporate politics, meeting protocol, mitigating coworker 
              jealousy, the clues one can intuit from the subtle behaviors of 
              fellow managers.</p>
			  
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
              Today, nearly five years since he worked in men's departments on 
              Michigan Avenue, David's career has flourished, as has his firm. 
              He is responsible for North American operations, earns in excess 
              of $250,000, and has developed the stable family life that he had 
              never had the time or means to pursue before. David did not need 
              a formal degree. </p>

		    <p class="subhead">Barbara: Moving from perfect to productive.</p>
			<p><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
              Barbara was a 'career drifter.' She had graduated with a bachelor's 
              degree in marketing and worked as an assistant account executive 
              for an international consumer packaged goods company-a promising 
              start. However, when she introduced herself to us, she was unhappy, 
              working as a waitress in an underperforming tourist destination 
              restaurant. She didn't know what she wanted to do or which direction 
              to move and she had been living paycheck to paycheck for too long. 
              She didn't see an exit from the career and life she had fallen into. </p>
            <p>Though Barbara's career had derailed at some point, as we came 
              to know her through exercises and in-session, we discovered that 
              other factors contributed to her unhappiness. Her career was merely 
              suffering a symptom of the larger problem: perfectionism.</p>
			<p><strong>Resolution:</strong><br>
              In Barbara's case, Jody Michael &amp; Associates sought to find 
              resolution for the career problem Barbara presented through a two-pronged 
              approach. On the one hand, we needed to help her discover her passions 
              again. On the other, if we didn't address her perfectionist thought 
              patterns, we knew that her unhappiness would persist no matter where 
              she found herself.</p>
            <p>From the first session, we understood that Barbara had a hard time 
              relating to co-workers, friends and acquaintances. She lacked a 
              healthy support network, close ties to friends and family members 
              that are mutually helpful and encouraging. In part, her difficult 
              home life as a child had led to this inability to connect interpersonally, 
              as an adult. Barbara felt she was always being critiqued by others, 
              and that she never achieved 'good enough.' In turn, she had closed 
              herself off, both by keeping to herself, and by judging those with 
              whom she had to interact regularly.</p>
            <p>On the career front, Barbara was all over the map. In early assessment 
              exercises at JMA, she had identified everything from river guide 
              to travel agent as possible jobs she might enjoy. In some ways, 
              she was constricted by her limited means. Through a series of exercises, 
              JMA found that Barbara enjoyed physical activity and working with 
              her hands, and the tangible world. This explained why she hadn't 
              stayed in her original field, marketing. This insight also enabled 
              us to narrow the field of possible careers she might find rewarding. 
              After four sessions, Barbara fixed upon carpentry as something she 
              would like to pursue next.</p>
              
            <p>She didn't necessarily need to find the career that would take 
              her through retirement. She just needed to know where to place her 
              next step. This is an important distinction. For people that wrestle 
              with perfectionist tendencies, decisions become difficult because 
              of a self-imposed permanence. In other words, Barbara feared making 
              a choice because she thought she had to find an answer that would 
              hold true throughout the rest of her life. Her fear was further 
              complicated by the doubts from a couple of mediocre career decisions.</p>
            <p>However, perfectionism plagued her in another way, as well. Not 
              only did she expect the utmost of herself, but she expected it of 
              others, as well. Judgment is a difficult platform from which to 
              jump into trusting relationships. Within ten sessions and two months 
              of diligent homework, Barbara gained self-confidence, saw the world 
              in more than black and white, and learned how to give people a break, 
              including herself. &quot;It's okay not to be flawless every step 
              of the way,&quot; she wrote. While Barbara has always had the skills 
              to persevere through adversity, she now says about herself, &quot;I 
              have a lot less fear and trepidation as I act&#8230;it's less of 
              a mental struggle&#8230; and I have a better feeling of being at 
              home in my skin, as I attempt the next thing.&quot; Further, she 
              had worked out an ongoing system that would increase her self-esteem, 
              reduce her fear, and maintain a stay on her excessive standards. 
              JMA also helped her identify a blueprint that strategically positioned 
              her for a successful career in carpentry.</p>
            <p>Carpentry requires special skills. Therefore, Barbara needed an 
              interim means of earning enough money to not only cover her living 
              expenses, but also afford the training for her new career. She now 
              had the confidence to take her restaurant skills from server to 
              bartender in the restaurant that she had worked which enabled her 
              to earn the extra money her new career direction required. </p>
              <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
              Barbara writes or calls periodically and lets us know how her career 
              and life are progressing. In a recent update, she wrote, &quot;I 
              successfully graduated from the Chicago Women in Trades Technical 
              Opportunities Program&#8230;I was chosen by my class to give a speech 
              at graduation, for which I received a standing ovation. It will 
              also be included in the [school's] newsletter.&quot; Furthermore, 
              she has developed a support network of friends she met in her training 
              program, and her new job is off to a promising start: &quot;[I] 
              had a review a month or two ago, and my boss told me she considers 
              me to be one of the best&#8230;.Several of my workmates have told 
              me that they like working with me most.&quot;</p>
            <p>Congratulations, Barbara!</p>

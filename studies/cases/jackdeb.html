		    <p class="subhead">Jack and Deb: Retirement Means Work</p>
			<p>For Jack and Deborah, retirement had always been (1) in the future (2) something they looked forward to and (3) something they needed to save for. The time came when suddenly, none of those were true. The future had arrived. The financial planning was now in maintenance. And the fantasy of retirement was well÷just that, fantasy.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, there is no prerequisite seminar that covers how to retire successfully.  Therefore, we are not surprised to learn that many professionals finish their careers only to recognize that they have finite time and money, but nothing worthwhile to do with their resources. Often, depression and anxiety loom as individuals try to cope with meaningfulness in the retirement years.</p>
		    <p><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
              Jack had retired from a large utility eleven months before he and 
              his wife, Deborah, called Jody Michael &amp; Associates. Their marriage 
              was a model of those from the early baby-boomer era: Deb raised 
              their children while Jack earned money to support the family. Their 
              children were now adults, living in different states with their 
              own families. The couple had prepared so that they would be financially 
              comfortable for the next twenty years, given regular market returns. 
              However, when they arrived, both were bored and unhappy.</p>
              
            <p><strong>Resolution:</strong><br>
              Deb had looked forward to retirement as an opportunity to spend 
              time with her life partner and to travel while her health was still 
              good. Jack on the other hand, had envisioned this a restful period 
              of his life, in which he could play golf and discover some hobbies 
              he liked at his leisure. Since he had traveled frequently for his 
              work, traveling did not hold the same appeal as it did his wife. 
              Further, Jack felt tired and unmotivated in the previous months. 
              And though he was able to rest, and did rest, he felt he was wasting 
              the life he'd been given.</p>
              <p>Jody Michael &amp; Associates recognizes that retirement can be 
              many things to many people. In this case, three stakeholders required 
              consideration: Jack, Deb, and the couple as a whole.</p>
              <p>After fifty-odd years of scripted life, Jack and Deb needed Ms. 
              Michael's exercises, questions, and ad hoc homework to rediscover 
              the interests they had thought would be bubbling to the surface. 
              The information they learned about their relationship and each other 
              was important for their future, but also disconcerting considering 
              they had been married for thirty-seven years. JMA helped Deb and 
              Jack through this discovery process and guided them to format the 
              new information in a way that guaranteed they would act on it. Their 
              schedule was flexible enough to allow changes in plans, but granted 
              all three stakeholders their needs.</p>
              
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
              Jack was comfortable with the allotment of time their schedule gave 
              him to recuperate and to play golf. As part of the program, Deborah 
              prioritized the destinations she wanted to visit and marked a block 
              of the calendar for each of the next four, depending on that destination's 
              optimal travel season.</p>
            <p>The couple recognized that they did not share all of the same interests 
              at home, or on trips. Therefore, both individuals could schedule 
              times to get their own needs met: for instance, her to look for 
              antiques and him to golf, again. Deborah recognized that she could 
              not depend on her husband as her only social outlet. She culled 
              her interests and decided to build a social network around two of 
              them by joining groups and participating in community forums. Concerned 
              that she would only meet other retirees, Deborah applied to docent 
              at a local art museum.</p>
              <p>This is the negotiation that Jody Michael &amp; Associates introduced 
              into Deb and Jack's retirement years. The dialogue not only kept 
              their relationship vital and new, but made sure that each person 
              took care of his needs as well as those of the couple. As a result 
              of this fresh focus and plan, Jack and Deborah were looking forward 
              to the next twenty years of their lives. They had scheduled specific 
              activities for the next year, planned future vacations and had a 
              larger set of goals each wanted to achieve in the following years. 
              Best of all, this plan accommodated the changes that their inevitable 
              self-discovery, both as individuals and as a couple, would bring.</p>

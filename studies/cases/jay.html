              Executive Coaching</p>
		    <p class="subhead">Jay: Your Life or Your Wife</p>
		    <p><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
              Jay, the successful CEO of a Fortune 50 company, had it all. In 
              his fifties, he had earned the means to retire in luxury, but his 
              passion for building corporations kept him in the business world. 
              He had been so immersed in work that he felt his children had grown 
              up without his participation. Though he experienced anxiety, Jay 
              only knew that things were amiss because people close to him told 
              him he was out of control. His doctor warned him that he had all 
              the indications of an impending heart attack. Jay's wife demanded 
              he either do something different to support their marriage, or she 
              was filing for a divorce. This is the situation that prompted Jay 
              to make his first appointment with Jody Michael &amp; Associates.</p> 
              
            <p><strong>Resolution:</strong><br>
              A no-nonsense person, Jay found coaching was more attractive to 
              him than psychotherapy. He valued the multi-disciplined approach 
              Jody Michael &amp; Associates employed in their coaching practice. 
              Further, he appreciated Ms. Michael's corporate experience and her 
              understanding of the necessity of confidentiality when working with 
              the corporate executive. His work colleagues needn't know he kept 
              weekly appointments by phone to work on his own issues. And due 
              to its convenience, the meetings did not raise suspicion.</p>
            <p>Within the first few sentences, JMA understood that Jay was talented 
              at ignoring his own body's feedback. Stress, anxiety and personal 
              loss indicated that he spent too many of his resources working. 
              Indeed, he enjoyed the rest of his life, but work didn't leave much 
              time for pleasure. With this information, Ms. Michael helped Jay 
              observe his own feedback. She asked him questions that developed 
              insight and self-reflection.</p>
            <p>After this initial breakthrough, JMA demonstrated how he could 
              find more time in the hours he had, and prioritize to even the balance 
              between family, self, and work. </p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
              Jay determined a schedule that included more time with his wife, 
              his children, and a new exercise regimen. JMA observed Jay's behavior 
              and pin-pointed his avoidant habits as no one else had been willing 
              to do. He received advice on how he should alleviate the time pressure 
              he had assumed was a part of corporate life. In coordination with 
              his doctor, a nutritionist, and a travel agent, Jody Michael &amp; 
              Associates implemented a program that included regular exercise, 
              heart-healthy meals, and long frequent vacations. As he observed 
              how recreation improved his health, his relationships, and his effectiveness 
              at work, Jay experienced that finding the time for leisure was not 
              the zero-sum game he had previously imagined. The biggest reward 
              Jay walked away with was a rekindled relationship with his wife 
              and kids. Near the end of our work, Jay's wife called and left the 
              following message: ...&quot;I don't know what you've done or how 
              you've done it, but I just wanted to call thank you&#8230;I feel 
              like I got my husband back and the kids got their father back&#8230;we've 
              actually scheduled our first two week family vacation instead of 
              our usual long-weekend getaway&#8230;Thank you. </p>

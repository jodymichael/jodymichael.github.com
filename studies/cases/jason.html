		    <p class="subhead">Jason: An About Face</p>
		    <p><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
              Jason founded a firm that provided hardware and software solutions 
              for the XYZ industry. He had practiced business skills and the pedigree 
              of an MBA from a prestigious school. Jason's long-term intentions 
              were to build this company's value, sell it in five to ten years, 
              and retire comfortably on the proceeds of the sale.</p>
              <p>However, the firm opened its doors just prior to 9/11. Due to the 
              subsequent economic fallout, his business experienced more turbulence 
              in its formative months than it would have under normal conditions. 
              Jason became very concerned.</p>
              <p>He had to provide confident leadership at a time when he was well 
              aware that the company was in serious trouble. He feared losing 
              his employees, if they sensed the company situation, so he chose 
              to shoulder this tremendous burden alone and figure out solutions 
              without counsel. With his company struggling to stay afloat, his 
              energy and confidence was going down with the company's bleak outlook. 
              Alone, desperate, and investing what he believed might very well 
              be his &quot;last dollars&quot; he called Jody Michael &amp; Associates 
              for some targeted business advice.</p>
            <p><strong>Resolution:</strong><br>
              Jody Michael provided Jason a savvy confidante and advocate. Their 
              contract allowed him a confidential sounding wall and a safe place 
              to regroup. Stripped of the politics and complexities of the workplace, 
              coach and client communicated efficiently to achieve amazing results 
              in a very short time.</p>
              <p>In an extended first session, Jody Michael worked with Jason in 
              two areas in which she felt were pivotal for Jason's comeback: (1) 
              immediately restore his confidence and enthusiasm and (2) redirect 
              his selling/marketing to more effectively close sells in the XYZ 
              industry. From a state of confusion, anxiety and uncertainty, Jason 
              left that first session hopeful, excited and challenged. Already 
              a driven businessman, he now had recaptured his confident demeanor, 
              redirected his focus, and was ready to implement the strategies 
              that JMA had suggested.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
              In eight years of coaching, this is the business turnaround Jody 
              marvels at most. After one face-to-face session, Jason accomplished 
              a 180-degree turn-around psychologically and sustained it throughout 
              the week. He was on fire. Jason now had the psychological foundation 
              necessary to revive the firm. His enthusiasm was infectious, his 
              team was inspired, and his actions were focused. He began to make 
              tough decisions and take bold actions.</p>
              <p>Due to his tremendous flexibility, decisiveness and focus, Jason 
              achieved stability and growth in his business and took employee 
              morale to new heights. His business was going to not only survive, 
              but thrive.</p>
              <p>After the initial crisis passed, Jason continued to work with Jody 
              Michael &amp; Associates. The coaching changed and evolved as the 
              company did. Later coaching topics included an overhaul of the firm's 
              marketing strategy, management of personnel issues, and sales force 
              performance improvement. With his business humming along, Jason 
              will be the first to tell you, those &quot;last dollars&quot; were 
              some of the best he ever spent.</p></td>

		    <p class="subhead">Rebecca: I feel like something's missing.</p>
			<p>Rebecca  gives us a great case study because her story is archetypal of many mid-career professionals we help.  The stereotypical midlife crisis recurs in our cultural heritage for good reason: it is an unfortunate and frequent dysfunction of modern life.  Life, however, does not have to work this way.</p>
			<p><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
              When Rebecca came to Jody Michael &amp; Associates, she had been 
              a prolific management consultant in a Fortune 20 firm for eight 
              years. At the time she contacted JMA, she was approximately one 
              year from becoming a partner. However, she had realized that the 
              business world did not contain her calling. Though her outward success 
              was the envy of many, she was not proud of her employment. Rebecca 
              hired Jody Michael &amp; Associates because she was dissatisfied 
              with her career.</p>
            <p><strong>Resolution:</strong><br>
              During the assessment process, Ms. Michael came to understand that 
              Rebecca was out-of-sorts in more areas of her life than just her 
              work life. JMA assigned Rebecca exercises that allowed her to probe 
              her dysfunctional beliefs, to uncover her self-imposed rules, and 
              to learn about how she had come to be the high-functioning, low-satisfaction 
              working adult that she was. Rebecca diligently worked in-session 
              and on assignments she could complete at her leisure. JMA provided 
              guidance and actionable steps that helped Rebecca work with the 
              personal traits and habits that had been getting in her way.</p>
              <p>She saw results quickly. She writes, &quot;Working with Jody, I 
              have been able to find and define my authentic self and begin living 
              my life for me, not for my family or based on what others expected 
              of me.&quot; In three to four months, Rebecca turned her life around. 
              She discovered the people and livelihood that fulfilled and refueled 
              her. Among other major life changes, Rebecca left the F20 firm so 
              that she could educate and role-model high school youth in inner-city 
              schools.</p>
              <p>Rebecca describes her success: &quot;I cannot remember another time 
              in my life where I have been this happy and at one with myself... 
              I am starting to feel things that I haven't ever allowed myself 
              to feel.&quot;</p>

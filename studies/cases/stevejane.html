		    <p class="subhead">Steve and Jane: What is success?</p>
		    <p><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
              Steve had the average American professional middle-aged-with-family 
              life. This was his problem, though he didn't know it. Instead, he 
              experienced an anxiety that grated at him occasionally, reminding 
              him that something was wrong.</p>
              <p>He and his wife owned their house. They both worked. Their children 
              were eight and eleven years old. However, other than the advancing 
              age of his children, Steve could not separate one year from another, 
              or weeks from other weeks. Day-to-day life occurred regularly. He 
              watched football on Sunday afternoons and Monday nights in the fall; 
              baseball in the spring and summer.</p>
              <p>It disturbed Steve that, if the previous six years were any indication, 
              he could predict what the next six would bring with a high degree 
              of accuracy. When Steve first came to see Jody Michael &amp; Associates, 
              he was living unconscious in his own skin. </p>
              
            <p><strong>Resolution:</strong><br>
              In the first three months of weekly sessions with JMA, Steve's coach 
              forced him to be uncomfortable. With JMA, he had bought a life necessity 
              none of his peers had experienced: an honest, diligent self-examination. 
              In the discomfort of figuring out who he was at middle-age, Steve 
              realized that the life he had been living had diverged from the 
              life he once envisioned for himself. The divergence had occurred 
              so long ago that he had given up; he had not dreamed, envisioned, 
              or challenged himself in years.</p>
              <p>Implementing small changes to get his inertia moving forward, Steve's 
              coach taught him how minor adjustments in his thought could result 
              in external change in his life. Slowly, as Steve unearthed more 
              features of his authentic self, he began to differentiate those 
              parts of his life that served him from those that caused friction 
              and anxiety. He realized he wanted to connect with his children 
              more. Prime time television lost much of its appeal. He now had 
              time to learn what sparked the imaginations of his kids. For the 
              eight year old, it was team sports. His eleven year old son was 
              just getting into model rockets.</p>
              <p>After three months of observing the positive change in her husband, 
              Steve's wife, Jane, asked to be introduced to Jody Michael &amp; 
              Associates. She had spent so much time caring for her family that 
              she had lost sight of her own needs. Working separately, both Steve 
              and Jane were engaging in an essential indulgence, rediscovering 
              the practices that fed them as individuals.</p>
              
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
              Jane and Steve emerged from their coaching experiences happier, 
              more active, and fulfilled. Each had learned what it feels like 
              to live consciously. Furthermore, they both had tools to preserve 
              and advance the deliberately effective lives they had created. Jane 
              determined that she needed a 'self' separate from her family. With 
              Steve's support, she found this extra space and time to care for 
              and renew herself. Steve received a promotion and a $20,000 increase 
              in salary, while he got involved in the lives and interests of his 
              children.</p>
              <p>Following their work individually, Steve and Jane attended four 
              coaching sessions together. In these meetings, JMA helped them incorporate 
              the new identities they had created into their relationship together, 
              found ways for each to support the other's individual growth, and 
              gave them specific ideas that their children could model.</p>

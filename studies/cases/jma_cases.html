		  <p class="subhead">Alexis: What do I want to be when I grow up?</p>
		  <p><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
            Alexis was a student in her first semester of college when her father 
            strongly suggested she visit Jody Michael &amp; Associates [JMA]. 
            He worried that she had already chosen a college curriculum and vocation 
            that didn't meet her needs: teaching. Luckily, Alexis's father had 
            not asked JMA to change Alexis's mind. However, he felt that JMA's 
            experience and separation from the situation would lead to a better 
            chance of our helping his daughter think through her career choice 
            than he had.</p>
            <p><strong>Resolution:</strong><br>
            Alexis was sent to us by her father. As such, our first priority was 
            establishing trust. The casual manner in which Jody Michael conducted 
            the session, as well as a guarantee of confidentiality no matter who 
            paid the bill, set Alexis at ease.</p>
            <p>Alexis had decided to pursue a degree in education so that she could 
            take a job as a K-12 teacher after graduation. She enjoyed helping 
            people and wanted a career that would be different, day-to-day. She 
            had an aversion to math, but most importantly, she feared making the 
            wrong choice. Alexis worried that she would be unable to support herself 
            as an adult. She also figured that the need for teachers would continue 
            indefinitely. Therefore, her choice was safe.</p>
            <p>Jody then changed the nature of the game by asking, &quot;What career 
            would you choose if I guaranteed you a job after graduation?&quot; 
            With this question, Alexis revealed that she was fascinated by other 
            means of helping people: psychology, criminology, and counseling. 
            'Psychologist' was actually her dream job. It allowed the practitioner 
            self-direction, and made use of one-to-one interaction. However, psychology 
            also entailed a focus on research and assessment she had little interest 
            in. It required a graduate degree, a commitment she was unwilling 
            to make. Lastly, she was wary of the job market.</p>
            <p>Teaching, it turned out, was a backup plan, a route she'd decided 
            upon because she was unsure of the future market for psychologists. 
            Unfortunately, Alexis' backup plan was not ideal. It was a 'helping' 
            profession, but certainly, it was repetitious from year to year, dealt 
            with the same kids day-to-day, and frequently, the same subject lesson, 
            from one hour to the next. Furthermore, it promised little autonomy 
            and required group leadership, a far cry from the intimate and personal 
            discussion that was possible one-on-one. On the positive side, however, 
            Alexis recognized the three advantages every teacher looks forward 
            to: June, July, and August.</p>
            <p>Having fleshed out which parts of Alexis' decision process were determined 
            by wants, needs, and fears, Jody suggested she consider social work. 
            Alexis had not considered this field seriously because she had limited 
            information about the profession.</p>
            <p>Jody has coached people from many professions and industries. Without 
            additional research, she told Alexis what she knew of social work. 
            No two clients were the same. Unlike psychology, social work did not 
            require the professional to administer a battery of tests and assessments. 
            The social worker-patient interaction was realMost importantly, school 
            social workers are not only in demand, but the job includes the three 
            month vacation that teachers get and Alexis coveted. In this way, 
            Alexis realized that the safe fall-back selection of 'teacher' was 
            not a good fit for her. If she succeeded in achieving this goal, she 
            would be dissatisfied. On the other hand, school social work satisfied 
            her passion for psychology and had the benefits of teaching but included 
            none of the related downsides. Alexis left the appointment with Jody 
            Michael excited to work toward her new career, confident that it was 
            something she would enjoy doing.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
            Alexis, after one extended session, had chosen a career that suited 
            her needs. Fear no longer drove her decisions. Most important: Alexis 
            was excited to start on this new adventure. After the session, she 
            returned to the college registrar's office to change her major and 
            get into the right classes.</p></td>

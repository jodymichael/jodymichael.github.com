		    <p class="subhead">John: Bull in a Chia Shop</p>
		    <p><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
              When he came to see Jody Michael &amp; Associates, John was a rising 
              star at a Fortune 100 company. However, after making the first appointment, 
              he asked us why he was seeing us. According to John, everything 
              in his life was great, unless you asked the people that had to work 
              around him. The breaking point occurred when, for the third year 
              in a row, John was denied a promotion to partner due to poor 360&deg; 
              reviews. </p>
              
            <p><strong>Resolution:</strong><br>
              John did not want to see Jody Michael &amp; Associates. However, 
              the possibility of not making partner a fourth time was an event 
              he loathed even more. Early in the assessment process, we realized 
              that John was not a good listener. Among other things, he was self-absorbed, 
              a bully, arrogant, anxious, had a temper, and was confrontational. 
              His reviews noted that he was considered a sub-par leader and that 
              he had anger-management issues.</p>
            <p>JMA cannot change a client that does not want to change himself. 
              John did not think his behavior needed modification. However, he 
              realized he was hitting a glass ceiling he didn&#8217;t like. We 
              explained to him that he had a choice: (1) He could find a firm 
              that promoted those with his personality traits, or (2) He needed 
              to learn how to work, lead, and communicate as his peers and coworkers 
              requested. He could improve his chances of making partner either 
              way. John decided to try the latter approach.</p>
            <p>Jody Michael engineered exercises and assignments that attacked 
              John&#8217;s belief system. He had grown up the youngest of five 
              boys. Thus, he learned early that life was not fair, that he had 
              to fight for what he wanted, and that bullying led to the spoils 
              rather than to punishment. He had brought this approach into the 
              business world, where the rules were different. In session, Ms. 
              Michael worked with John so that he got practice in the situations 
              that usually brought on his unruly behavior. He learned management 
              techniques, how to read people, how to work a room, and how to discover 
              what others thought of him. </p>
              
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong><br>
              John realized that he needed to bring his focus outside of himself 
              and onto the people around him. However, while John successfully 
              achieved a change in how he addressed situations, he realized the 
              goal that brought him to JMA in the first place. The next year, 
              his 360&deg; reviews improved markedly and his firm promoted him 
              to partner. One of his co-workers went so far as to say that she 
              had witnessed a &quot;remarkable transformation.&quot;<br>

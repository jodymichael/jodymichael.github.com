	<li>&#8220;Throughout Jody Michael’s workshop <em>Life RoadMap</em> I kept thinking, I wish I had gotten this information 20 years ago! If I had, I believe that my life would be a lot different.&#8221;<br />
<cite>&#8212; Linda Romanowski, Nurse</cite></li>
	<li>&#8220;At the core, this workshop will leave you with this: Whether you are conscious of it or not, you are in charge of one major ‘art project’ this lifetime: creating yourself. Be prepared to ask yourself questions you have never asked, look at things you normally wouldn’t and get lots of research data to support the change processes offered. Impactful. I would highly recommend this workshop.&#8221;<br />
<cite>&#8212; Catherine Brockman, <span class="caps">MBA</span> Graduate student</cite></li>
	<li>&#8220;I highly recommend the <em>Life ToolBox</em> and <em>Life RoadMap</em> workshops. I cannot imagine a person who would walk away from this &#8216;Owner’s Manual for Living Successfully&#8217; (that’s what I would name the workshops) without some new thoughts, tools or strategies that, if applied, would make a huge difference in their life. While Jody can’t go home with you, her processes and tools can. They are simple and powerful and effective.&#8221;<br />

	<li>&#8220;Thank you for a workshop that connected me to what I am doing that has not been working in my life. I have been sabotaging myself for years and I was completely unaware. I have been spinning my wheels for years not knowing how to get off that treadmill. For the first time in my life, I feel clear and hopeful about my future and the actions necessary to create it.&#8221;<br />

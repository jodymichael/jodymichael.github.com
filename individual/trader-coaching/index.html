	<li>&#8220;I read all the psychological trading books. I re-read them. It was frustrating. I couldn’t put into practice what the books were telling me to do. That’s what prompted me to get coaching. <br />
  Having someone I can meet with, and be accountable to for the things I am working on, has made a noticeable difference. Each week I work on very specific things. Observe, adjust, execute. Our sessions are used as a critical review. What am I working on now? How did I do? What do I need to work on now? Very, very valuable stuff.&#8221;<br />
<cite>&#8212; Kevin D., Independent Nasdaq / E-Mini Trader</cite></li>
	<li>&#8220;Our work together led me to personal decisions I once lacked the courage to make on my own. I am much happier as a result, and look forward to a fulfilling career helping others. Jody allowed me to view myself in a different light.&#8221;<br />

	<li>&#8220;Results. That’s why I showed up in her office and that’s what she delivered. I can think of three things specifically that resulted in me being able to take my trading to the next level.<br />
1. I am more aware. Yes, I know this sounds strange but being aware of myself, my quirks and my thinking have made all the difference in the world. <br />
2. I have virtually eliminated negative patterns that have existed since I started trading. They are: overtrading and undisciplined, sloppy thinking.<br />
3. I have tools that help me everyday. They keep me accountable and maintain my good habits. <br />
I would recommend Jody to anyone who is willing to make a committed effort to becoming a better trader through mental practices.&#8221;<br />
<cite>&#8212; Jeff M., Electronic S&amp;P trader</cite></li>
	<li>&#8220;I was embarrassed to tell anyone I saw a ‘coach.’ I was embarrassed that I could not figure this out on my own. I was embarrassed to tell my story when I finally did show up in her office. Now, I’m embarrassed that I waited so long to hire a trader coach! Jody saved me money, unnecessary pain, frustration, and sleepless nights.<br />
  For me, this process was more than trader coaching. Jody was the stimulus that ignited within me a focused direction, intentionality and a deep sense of peace that I had never experienced before in my life or my work. That’s just the side dish. The main dish of our work was successfully overcoming my core trading issue: scattered, emotion-based, inconsistent trading. I would recommend Jody without reservation and I have.&#8221;<br />

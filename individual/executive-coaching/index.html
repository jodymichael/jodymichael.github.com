                <p>Ambitious, growth-driven individuals who aspire to aggressively move up the corporate ladder often hire their own executive coach. Their interest in acquiring new awareness about themselves and adding more tools to their toolbox help drive their performance to the next level.</p>

	<li>&#8220;I have found that the professional, personal and financial payoff for hiring an executive coach can be tremendous. I went from floundering and confused in my career, not knowing what I wanted to do professionally to choosing a career, excelling in that career, starting my own business, and being offered position of Chief Technology Officer. This happened in four short years. None of this would have been possible without career and executive coaching from Jody Michael. The work changed my life.&#8221;<br />
<cite>&#8212; Dustin Anderson, Chief Technology Officer, Eliason Media.</cite></li>
	<li>&#8220;Jody brings an amazing combination of intellect, insight, empathy, corporate savvy, objectivity, and philosophy to the table. So she is able not only to help people identify their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, but also provides tools for them to achieve the next level. And all this with a view to sustainable real change &#8211; not a temporary crutch, but an integrated approach to bringing forth your source of greatest energy.&#8221;<br />

	<li>&#8220;Jody Michael helped me get back in touch with my true passions and ambitions. After spending 16 turbulent years at the VP-level in several Fortune 500 companies, I thought I had all the answers. Nevertheless, I decided to use Jody as my Executive Coach ‘to keep me honest’ during my next job search. Jody took me through a process of introspection and discovery tailored specifically to my needs. To my surprise, I came out the other end of this process with a much different, and much better, view of myself, my abilities, and the options available to me. Today, I’m much happier, healthier, and professionally fulfilled because Jody helped me listen to what my inner self has been telling me for a long time. I did the work, but Jody guided me through every step. I would heartily recommend her to anyone seeking to get themselves ‘back on track’ &#8211; whether personally or professionally.&#8221;<br />

	<li>&#8220;Jody has an exceptional ability to produce results for her clients by helping them focus their attention on the most important issues of any given situation. The benefits that I have derived from our working relationship are immeasurable and I would recommend her without hesitation.&#8221;<br />
